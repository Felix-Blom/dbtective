# DOC001: description

**Category:** Documentation  
**Short Description:** Resources must have description

Derived from dbt best practices.

## What it does

Checks for dbt resources (models, sources, snapshots) that lack description.

## Why is this bad?

Resources without descriptions are difficult for other team members to understand and maintain. Descriptions help explain the purpose, business logic, and expected usage of the resource.

## Example

**Bad:**
```yaml
# models/schema.yml
models:
  - name: users
    # No description provided

sources:
  - name: raw_data
    tables:
      - name: users
        # No description provided
```

```sql
-- models/users.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='table'
    -- No description in config
) }}

select * from {{ ref('raw_users') }}
```

**Good:**
```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    description: "User data from our application including registration and profile information"

sources:
  - name: raw_data
    description: "Raw data from our production database"
    tables:
      - name: users
        description: "Raw user data before transformation"
```

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    description='Cleaned and transformed user data ready for analytics'
) }}

select * from {{ ref('raw_users') }}
```

## Options

- `min_description_length`: Minimum required length for descriptions (default: 10)
- `allow_empty_for_tags`: Allow empty descriptions if certain tags are present (default: [])
